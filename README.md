Welcome to this repository! :octocat:

Here you will find some interest projects that I have made during my studies in NLP field.

## Summary from each project

### First challange

On this first challange you will find how to do a vectorization without any special library, just working with Numpy. The three vectorization methods that were applied on this notebook are OneHotEncoding, Frecuency vectors and TF-IDF.

At the end there is a comparison between this vectorization method applied to a small corpus.

### Second challange
